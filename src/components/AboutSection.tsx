      Busy Master game is an otome game with Chinese art style developed by BluStar Games Limited. Players will play as the main character who plays the role of managing a broken house and becoming its master. Here players will meet various love interests who are voiced by famous Chinese voice actors. This is a fantasy world named Yong. Yong originally referred to the extra layer of protection around the peripheral of a city. Now it means harmony and shelter. You were summoned through time and space by chance to face a battle against extermination without knowing what’s going on, but you know it’s serious. You had thought this was all a dream. However, after awakening the sect’s divine guardian beast you have no choice but to believe the tragic reality you face.
      The sect leader you’ve transmigrated into has no luxurious clothes or extravagant meals, she has no heart-warming disciples. She only has a dilapidated courtyard and the identity as a notorious villain in Jianghu…
      Apparently, you have an eccentric master who’s abandoned you and smears your name out there, and a ‘white lotus’ 1 senior sister who is possessed by a demon near you. You even have a divine beast you are linked to, in which you had no say in. The beast is a professional at getting in your way and comes with the “I disagree for the sake of disagreeing” element. It’s in no rush to find the other half of its body. Instead, it racks its brains to promote the handsome men of the seven major clans of this world to you.
